# Bowling ball scraper/database

Serverless (AWS SAM) pipeline that scrapes bowling ball manufacturer sites into
a normalized Postgres database, feeding a consumer informational site and
reconciliation against bowlerdepot.com's BigCommerce catalog. Full design
rationale, the schema, and the decisions behind it live in
`brunswick-scraper-architecture-review.md` (one level up from this repo) --
read that first if anything here seems under-explained.

## What's actually built right now

- `template.yaml` -- SAM template with one working function, `UrlDiscoveryFunction`.
- `db/migrations/001_init_schema.sql` -- full schema: brands, `ball_families` ->
  `products` -> `product_skus`, image storage, URL discovery tracking, the
  cross-source review queue, and BowlerDepot reconciliation tracking.
- `src/url_discovery/app.py` -- sitemap-based URL discovery, the first slice of
  the "Suggested build order" in the architecture doc.
- `tests/` -- unit tests for the URL discovery parsing/diff logic, run against
  a **real** sitemap sample captured from brunswickbowling.com during
  research (see the comment block in `tests/fixtures/bowlerProducts_sitemap_sample.xml`
  for exactly what's real vs. what's a deliberately-included edge case).

Everything else in the architecture doc's build order (HTML product scraper,
PDF mass-bias parser, image mirroring/centering pipeline, FastAPI admin API)
is intentionally not stubbed out yet -- see the commented-out section at the
bottom of `template.yaml` for what's next and why it's not speculative
boilerplate today.

## Why there's no live end-to-end test yet

This session's sandbox has restricted outbound network access, so I couldn't
execute `fetch_sitemap()` against the real internet from here, and I don't
have your AWS credentials to actually deploy and invoke this. What I *did*
verify:

- The sitemap structure, namespace, and URL/lastmod shape are real, captured
  directly from brunswickbowling.com during the architecture research (not
  guessed at).
- `parse_sitemap()` and `diff_against_known()` are pure functions I ran
  directly against that real fixture data in this session and confirmed
  correct output (6 ball URLs found, apparel URL correctly excluded,
  current/retired correctly classified from the path, real lastmod values
  parsed, missing lastmod handled without raising).
- `db/migrations/001_init_schema.sql` was reviewed by hand for syntax
  (couldn't spin up Postgres in this sandbox to run it directly -- no root
  access to install the server, and package installs were blocked this
  session). Worth running `sam local` / a real `psql` pass yourself before
  trusting it blindly, same as any migration you didn't watch execute.

None of that substitutes for actually running this against AWS. Treat this as
"the logic is verified, the deployment isn't."

## Getting this running

1. **Provision Postgres** (RDS or otherwise) and run the migration:
   ```
   psql "$DATABASE_URL" -f db/migrations/001_init_schema.sql
   ```
2. **Seed the `brands` row** this deployment discovers URLs for, e.g.:
   ```sql
   insert into manufacturers (name) values ('Brunswick Bowling & Billiards') returning id;
   insert into brands (manufacturer_id, name, base_url, source_platform, sitemap_url)
   values ('<manufacturer-id>', 'Brunswick', 'https://brunswickbowling.com', 'craft_cms',
           'https://brunswickbowling.com/sitemaps-1-section-bowlerProducts-1-sitemap.xml')
   returning id;
   ```
   Keep that `id` -- it's the `BrandId` parameter below.
3. **Store DB credentials in Secrets Manager** as a JSON secret shaped
   `{"host", "port", "dbname", "username", "password"}`. Note its ARN.
4. **Deploy**:
   ```
   sam build
   sam deploy --guided
   ```
   You'll be prompted for `DbSecretArn` and `BrandId`; `SitemapUrl` and
   `UrlPathPattern` default to Brunswick's values and don't need to be set
   unless you're deploying a second stack for Radical or DV8 (same Craft CMS
   template -- see the parameter descriptions in `template.yaml`).
5. **Run the tests** (once you have `pytest` available -- this session's
   sandbox couldn't install it, so it's unverified in the pytest runner
   itself, only via the manual equivalent described above):
   ```
   pip install pytest
   pytest tests/ -v
   ```

## Reusing this for Radical / DV8

Brunswick, Radical, and DV8 share the same Craft CMS template and URL shape
(confirmed during research -- same SEOmatic meta tags, same
`/products/balls/current/{slug}` structure, same DigitalOcean Spaces CDN
naming). Deploy a second SAM stack with `SitemapUrl` pointed at
`radicalbowling.com`'s or `dv8bowling.com`'s equivalent sitemap and a
different `BrandId`, rather than writing new code.

Hammer/Ebonite/Track/Powerhouse (Shopify) don't need this function at all --
pull `/products.json` directly once the product scraper exists.
